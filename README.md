Hiya! My name is Garrett Brown, and I'm an aspiring Software Dev! I'm currently an Intern at Hubb in Portland for the next 5 weeks or so and I'm super stoked to be a part of the programming world! I live in SE Portland and went to Epicodus coding bootcamp for about 6 months! My main passions in software include awesome UI/UX experiences, visual arts, animation, game-design, and music creation! 

📃 About Me:
- 😄 Pronouns: ** he/him **

- 👣 Next steps for me ... interning with Hubb Software!! 🦾

** MY STATS ARE BUGGED! I have no idea why, but JavaScript is definitely my most use language, followed by C#, HTML, CSS, Processing (Which isn't appearing for whatever reason...) and C++. **
