Hiya! My name is Garrett Brown, and I'm an aspiring Software Dev! I'm currently looking for my first job in the tech industry and I'm super stoked to be a part of the programming world! I am also helping Kona Connect to work on their chat bot, Sophia for domestic abuse survivors! I live in SE Portland and went to Epicodus coding bootcamp for about 6 months! My main passions in software include awesome UI/UX experiences, visual arts, animation, game-design, and music creation!

Update 11/15/2021: Wow! It's been a second since I've had consistant commits, huh? While there are a few projects I've been contributing to that aren't showing on my GH feed, namely Sophia, I've also been running into some issues with my mental health that have been preventing mefrom wanting to code, namely, Imposter Syndrome. Plus I've been focusing a little too heavily on applying for jobs over honing my skills, but I'm ready to crack back into coding, and I'm starting by re-upping on JavaScript, my favorite language! :D

** PLEASE NOTE, my stats do not necessarily reflect my proficiency in said languages, as I just started C++, yet the one repo I have most-likely contains more data than my other projects combined, due to it containing a framework engine that isn't my own. At Epicodus I studied JavaScript and C#! I would personally rank my skills as such:

1.) JavaScript (This includes React, Three.Js, Matter.js, P5, jQuery and more.)
2.) C# (Includes MySQL, and Unity.)
3.) Processing and Java
4.) TypeScript (Angular.)
5.) WordPress
6.) C++
