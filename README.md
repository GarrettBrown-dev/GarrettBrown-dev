** PLEASE NOTE, my stats do not necessarily reflect my proficiency in said languages, as I just started C++, yet the one rep I have most-likely contains more data than my other projects combined, due to it containing a framework engine that isn't my own. At Epicodus I studied JavaScript and C#! I would personally rank my skills as such:

1.) JavaScript (This includes React, Three.Js, Matter.js, P5, jQuery and more.)
2.) C# (Includes MySQL, and Unity.)
3.) Processing and Java
4.) TypeScript (Includes only Angular.)
5.) C++
